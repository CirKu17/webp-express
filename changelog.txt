= 0.4.0 =
This version fixes some misbehaviours and provides new http headers with info about the conversion process.

* Fixed bug: .htaccess was not updated every time the settings was saved.
* Fixed bug: The plugin generated error upon activation.
* Now produces X-WebP-Convert-And-Serve headers with info about the conversion - useful for validating that converter receives the expected arguments and executes correctly.
* WebPExpress options are now removed when plugin is uninstalled.
* No longer generates .htaccess rules on install. The user now has to actively go to Web Express setting and save first
* Added a "first time" message on options page and a reactivation message
For more info, see the closed issues on the github repository: https://github.com/rosell-dk/webp-express/milestone/1?closed=1

= 0.3 =
* Now works on LiteSpeed webservers
* Now sends X-WebP-On-Demand headers for easier debugging

        <i>WebP Express serves webp to browsers that supports it by redirecting
        the original image request (internally on server, it is not a 301 redirect).
        If no webp is yet generated, the request will be redirected to the image converter
        which generates the webp. On subsequent requests, the image is redirected (again, internally) directly
        to the webp, by means of a rule in the .htaccess.</i>

    Combined with a plugin that can alter HTML for webp-use (ie Cache Enabler or Shortpixel), the redirection trick can be avoided.</i>
    <div class="help">?<div class="popup">
        Benefits of avoiding the redirection trick:
        <ol>
            <li>CDN's will not have to be set up to forward the Accept header</li>
            <li>If a user downloads an image, it will not have wrong file extension</li>
        </ol>
        PS: The FAQ has instructions for using WebPExpress with Cache Enabler and Shortpixel

    <i>An auto-convert option is available!</i>
    <div class="help">?<div class="popup">
        <em>The auto-convertion works this way: When an image is requested, a rule in the .htaccess detects if
        that image has been converted. If not, the request is redirected to the converter, which creates the
        webp and returns <em>the original</em> image</em>
